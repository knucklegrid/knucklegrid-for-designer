# Knuckle Grid

## Notes for the designer

A mockup of the app is supplied with React components using Tailwind styling. This is a functioning mockup with clickable elements.

- Click the header menu items to reveal modals
- Click the grid squares to reveal a search modal

The list items in the search modal represent the 3 states of search results, which are:

- An unused guess
- A used guess
- An incorrect guess

The fully functioning game can be interacted with at https://knucklegrid.vercel.app/. Use an incognito window to reset your guesses.

### Requirements

Use the supplied designs as reference and adjust tailwind styling of the components to match the designs.

- Use only Tailwind
- Create both a dark and a light theme
- Create styling for all breakpoints (a responsive layout)

Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub with your changes
