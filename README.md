# Knuckle Grid

## Notes for the designer

A mockup of the Knuckle Grid game is supplied. This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [React](https://react.dev/) components using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) styling.

To run the project do the following:

1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/mattvick/knucklegrid-for-designer.git`
1. `cd knucklegrid-for-designer`
1. `npm i`
1. `npm run dev`

#### Interactivity

This is a functioning mockup with clickable elements.

- Click the header menu items to reveal modals
- Click the grid squares to reveal a search modal

The list items in the search modal represent the 3 states of search results, which are:

- An unused guess
- A used guess
- An incorrect guess

The fully functioning game can be interacted with at https://knucklegrid.vercel.app/. Use an incognito window to reset your guesses.

### Requirements

Use the supplied designs as reference and adjust the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) styling of the components to match the designs.

- Use only [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Create both a dark and a light theme
- Create styling for all breakpoints (a responsive layout)
